### About Data 

The data refer to season 2017/2018 of five national soccer competitions in Europe: Spanish first division, Italian first division, English first division, German first division, French first division. These competitions are the most important in Europe according to the UEFA country coefficient, which is used to rank the football associations of Europe and thus determine the number of clubs from an association that will participate in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League [uefa footbals](https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2019). In addition, we provide the data of the World cup 2018 and the European cup 2016, which are competitions for national teams. In total, we provide seven data sets corresponding to information about all competitions, matches, teams, players, events, referees and coaches. Each data set is provided in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation), an open-standard file format that uses human-readable and machine-processable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). Table 1 shows the list of competitions we make available with their total number of matches, events and players. The data covers a total of around 1,941 matches, 3,251,294 events and 4,299 players.
